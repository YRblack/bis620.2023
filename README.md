The bis620.2023 package is developed as an extension of our midterm
project in BIS 620 Fall 2023. This package is structured to encompass a
comprehensive suite of functions and datasets used in our midterm
project.

Core Functionality: The core of the bis620.2022 lies the `start_shiny`
function. This function serves as a gateway to an interactive Shiny
application, designed to provide an user-friendly interface for
exploring the extensive data from clinicaltrials.gov trials. The
application is tailored to facilitate in-depth analysis and
visualization of clinical trial data.
